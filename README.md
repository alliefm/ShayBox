## [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/alliefm/ShayBox/blob/main/README.md#troubleshooting)

## Pusheen Clock
This mode shows you the time. The color of the clock changes based on the time of day.

## Messages
This mode will show you messages. When a new message is received, the Mode Select button will light yellow. (It will do this regardless of what mode you are in). 
Your message will repeatedly scroll across the screen in this mode. If there is no new message, it will say "No new messages". If there was a new message, it will be displayed and the Mode Select button will go back to blue.
Many messages will be questions. You can answer "Yes" or "No" to questions by pressing the Green ("Yes"), or Red ("No") buttons. 
Once you press a Green or Red button, you will be returned back to the Pusheen Clock mode.

## Do Not Disturb
In this mode you can indicate that you wish to now be disturbed for a period. You can select between 1, 2, or 3 hours. Toggle between these selections using the Red button, and make your selection using the Green button. Once you press the Green button, you will be returned to the Pusheen Clock mode.
A Do Not Disturb notice will be sent that sets the future time that your DND period ends. In other words, if it is 10:37am and you elect DND for 3 hours, the notification will set 1:37pm as the earliest that you may be disturbed.

## Weather
This mode shows the weather for Redwood City.

## Nyan Pusheen
This mode shows an animated Pusheen cat flying through space in a donut...because I made the animation and wanted to use it somewhere.

## Troubleshooting
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
